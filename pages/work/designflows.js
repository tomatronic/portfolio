                        <p>The brief itself requested a new mobile app to be designed to allow a user to hire a toolkit from a location nearby for a specific task.</p>
                        <p>For example I may need to put some shelves up, I would visit this app and find a location to pick a toolkit up containing required tools from a specified pick up location.</p>
                        <p>The brief specified 3 specific pages that required designing:</p>
                        <p>&bull; <b>Toolkit rental</b> - This had to include a search bar<br/>
                        &bull; <b>My rentals</b> - Manage and rack bookings<br/> 
                        &bull; <b>How it works</b> - Instructions on how to collect a toolkit</p>
                        <p>As well as an app icon and a poster that presented the screens.</p>

                        <p>The key to any project is to ensure a thorough discovery process.</p>
                        <p>In order to understand the problem to the fullest I first reviewed the current platform and flows associated with the management of offers. I mapped out the flow within Miro using screenshots from the legacy dashboard. This ensured I had a full understanding of how the feature was already working and gain some inital insight into where improvements could be made.</p>
                        <p>However, I will not jump to conclusions without gaining input from the user.</p>

                        <p>In order to understand the problem to the fullest I first reviewed the current platform and flows associated with the management of offers. I mapped out the current screens in Miro to have a visual representation of the feature.</p>
                        <p>It was now time to capture some qualitative data. To do this created a small survey within a google form to distribute amongst the account management teams to help gather a better understanding of how they interacted with this feature, it was also a chance for me to understand known pain points that the team have been presented with over the years. The reason I chose the account managers was due to the level of exposure they have to both the platform and the end users. The personal connection created here often give valuable insight that may not be otherwise captured.</p>
                        <p>Once I had a pool of data collated I created a affinity diagram to help group the results I had received, this helped me to identify and prioritise points in the next step of the process. I was also able to follow up with some of the participants to further discuss their inputs. I feel this additional step is important, not only will it ensure that the survey answers are fully understood, it creates an additional layer of empathy to help understand the goal of the project.</p>

                        <p>Once happy with the flow I opened my notepad and began sketching some initial ideas. At this stage I scribble a lot of ideas down both illustrated and in note form, it can look like a mess but I find it helps to get all my ideas on paper. This also allows me to quickly eliminate ideas or come back to ideas at a later date if needed. As I develop an idea I start to sketch it into something of higher quality to allow me to easily translate it to a digital wireframe when the time comes.</p>

                        <p>In order to validate my ideas I proceeded to complete a round of simple user testing. Rather than exposing my test candidates to my crude sketches I went ahead and created simple wireframes within sketch that I could share and gather some initial feedback. I used to Zoom to conduct interviews with the candidates and get them to complete a set of simple tasks. This first round of testing allowed me to identify that the users were wanting a dedicated landing page for offer invitations alongside the proposed notification based system.</p>

                        <p>I continued to slowly increase the complexity of my mocks, allowing the user to gain more understanding of the goal driven outcome. Once the mockups reached a certain point I began mapping them into a map of hotspots within sketch to allow the creation of a interactive prototype. This prototype creates a more linear flow but enables a test candidate to become much more immersed in the test and provide much more beneficial feedback.</p>

                        <p>After performing a number of protoype testing sessions I came to the conclusion a couple of further design adjustments were required. This involved a round of iterations to ensure functionality was highlighted in a relevant way and that offers were made easier to compare with existing options.</p>

                        <p>Since the updated offer management flow and UI has been implemented we have seen a reduction in the amount of support tickets raised, and account managers have reported less queries based around offer management. The account management have said that this reduction in queries has led to them having more time to focus on the users needs and build better relationships with them.</p>
                        <p>The product has only been released recently so I will continue to monitor usage through the FullStory application, allowing me to perform iterative design amends to ensure a continual progression to the applications development.</p>
